## Problem Statement 
To better understand the problem statement you can visit this link :-[Kaggle Comptetion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019/overview).

## Dataset 
To Download The Dataset use the link :- [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019/data).

## Libraries 
Many libraries while importing may give error . Please do install them and then try again .

## User Interface 
The simple TKinter user interface is being used which is fully functional and takes the user input from the already saved files .

## About Files
--> Text Files store the tags as per the order they need to be used in the model.
--> The models and weights are separately stored and can be used as per user convenience.
--> The TKinter User Interface is very basic but is dynamic as far as input is concerned.

## Extras 
If you want to just check the working you do not need to run the model files . Just use the Call or Tkinter files and they will give the specific tags.
